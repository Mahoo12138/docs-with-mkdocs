# The blood of poor Americans is now a leading export, bigger than corn or soy

America is one of the only developed countries in the world that pays people to donate blood, much of it sold abroad (70% of the world's ==plasma== is of US origin), and as commercial blood donations have ==soared==, blood now accounts for 2% of the country's exports -- more than corn or soya.

There's more growth ahead for blood products, expected to "grow ==radiantly==" according to an analyst who was cheering 13% growth between 2016-17.

One study found that the typical blood-seller ==derives== a third of their income from selling blood. Princeton's Kathryn Edin called the commercial blood industry "the lifeblood of the $2 a day poor."

Mintpress(<font size="2">新闻媒体组织</font>)'s interviews with blood-sellers reveal "a mix of disabled, working poor, homeless, single parents, and college students," who describe a system of ==arbitrary== and ==predatory== payments, which ==fluctuate== wildly from day to day.

Respondents all agreed that they were indeed being ==exploited==, but in more ways than one. Desperate Americans are allowed to donate twice per week (104 times per year). But losing that much plasma could have serious health consequences, most of which have not been studied Professor Schaefer warns, stressing that more research is necessary. Around 70 percent of donors experience health ==complications==. Donors have a lower ==protein== count in their blood, putting them at greater risk of ==infections== and liver and kidney ==disorders==. Many regulars suffer from near-==permanent== ==fatigue== and are borderline anemic. All this for an average of $30 per visit. Rachel described the terrible Catch-22 many of the working poor find themselves in:

“I got ==turned away== twice – once for being too dehydrated and once for being anemic. Being poor created a shitty ==paradox== where I couldn’t eat, and because I couldn’t eat my iron levels weren’t high enough to allow me to donate. That was a week of a pay cut, money I desperately needed for rent and bills and meds.”
