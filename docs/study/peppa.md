### 不仅仅是英语

+ 当佩奇妈妈看到佩奇在泥水坑里蹦迪时，并没有因为太脏而阻拦她，或者是埋怨责骂她，而是告诉她要玩就要把靴子穿上，而告诉我们的是，在教育孩子的时候，不应太过强势，应该以商量的口吻与孩子交谈，如果是埋怨或者责骂，孩子肯定会根植于心灵，毕竟父母是孩子的最好的老师，在没有自己的思想时，啥都会跟着学。
+ 当佩奇和弟弟弄得一身脏的走进屋的时候，爸爸明显一眼就能看出来这俩经历了什么，但爸爸并没有马上生气和责骂或置之不理，而是温和地回答佩奇的问题，并且说要在妈妈看到之前洗干净，充分给予孩子尊重让孩子学会处理问题。

Sometimes, George likes to scare Peppa with Mr. Dinosaur.

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Eeek. Too scary. At suppertime, Mr. Dinosaur sits next to George. 

==I beg your pardon==. Was that you George, or was it Mr. Dinosaur?

    	Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said 15 pence, not 50.
    
    3. **used to show that you strongly disagree with something that someone has said, or think it is unacceptable**
    
    	‘Chicago’s an awful place.’ ‘I beg your pardon, that’s where I’m from!’




DineDine SawSaw. At bath time, George shares his bath with Mr. Dinosaur.

Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. Goodnight, Peppa.Goodnight, Mummy. Goodnight, George.

George's favourite game is throwing Mr. Dinosaur *up in the air...*

Wheeeeeeeee. Peppa and Daddy Pig are playing draughts.

> **draughts** [国际跳棋] **GAME** **[uncountable]** a game played by two people, each with 12 round pieces, on a board of 64 squares

I win, Daddy. Oh, welldone, Peppa. Whhhhaaaaaaaaaaa.

George? Whaaaaaaaaa. George, what's the matter? Dinosaur...

George, have you lost Mr. Dinosaur? George has lost Mr. Dinosaur.

Don't worry George. We'll find Mr. Dinosaur. It's a job for a detective. Daddy, what is a detective?

>  **detective** [警探、侦探] **noun** **[countable]** a police officer whose job is to discover information about crimes and catch criminals 

A detective is a very important person who is good at finding things.

Me. Me. I'm good at finding things. Alright. Peppa is the detective. George. I am the detective.

I will help you find Mr. Dinosaur. Maybe the detective should ask

George some simple questions. George? Where's Mr. Dinosaur?

Whaaaaaaaaaa. George did not know where Mr. Dinosaur is. 

The detective could try and guess where Mr. Dinosaur might be. I know. I know where he is.

George always has Mr. Dinosaur with him in the bath.

So Mr. Dinosaur is in the bath. Mr. Dinosaur is not in the bath. Oh. I know. 

I know where Mr. Dinosaur is. George always has Mr. Dinosaur in his bed at night. 

So that's where he is. Mr. Dinosaur is not in George's bed.

Oh. Maybe we should try the garden. Yes, the garden.

I was going to see that. Where is Mr. Dinosaur?

!!! note "I was going to see that"
    这是过去将来时的表达，*[was/were + going to + VERB]*，表示过去打算或准备做什么。
    还有一种形式则是 *[would + VERB]*，例如 I knew you would help him.
    
    Future in the past is used to express the idea that in the past you thought something would happen in the future. It does not matter if you are correct or not. 
    
    "Would" is used to volunteer or promise, and "was going to" is used to plan. Moreover, both forms can be used to make predictions[预言，预测] about the future.
    
    Examples:
    
    + I told you he **was going to** come to the party. *plan*
    + I knew Julie **would** make dinner. *voluntary action*
    + Jane said Sam **was going to** bring his sister with him, but he came alone. *plan*
    + I had a feeling that the vacation **was going to** be a disaster. *prediction*
    + He promised he **would** send a postcard from Egypt. *promise*


Mr. Dinosaur is very hard to find. Oh. Mr. Dinosaur *isn't anywhere.*

George? You do love to throw Mr. Dinosaur in the air...

I wonder if this time you threw Mr. Dinosaur just a bit too high.

There he is. There he is. I saw him first.

Well done, Peppa. You really are a very good detective.

DineDine SawSaw. Grrrrrrrrrr. George is so happy to have Mr. Dinosaur back again.

Wheeeeeeeeee. Maybe it isn't a good idea to play with dinosaurs near trees.  Dinosaur.

### 连读部分注意

+  is tucked up with —— is **tucke** **dup** with
+  who is good at —— who is **goo-dat**
+ up in the air —— **upin** the air
+ isn't anywhere —— **isn'-tany** where

### 不仅仅只是英语

+ 在孩子遇到困难的时候，父母应该擅长于引导孩子如何去处理，而不是包揽在自身，就像佩奇爸爸和妈妈一步一步让佩奇成为小侦探一样；
+ 其次，孩子更多需要的是直接的鼓励，常把 *Well Done!* 挂在嘴边。

They are best friends. Peppa, Why don't you and Suzy go and play in your bedroom?

Yes, Mummy! George wants to play, too. Peppa and Suzy love playing in Peppa's bedroom.

So does George. No, George. This game is just for big girls. Go and play with your own toys.

        *I don't need anyone's pity or help, I can make it all on my own, thank you very much.*

George, I need some help!! I'm making chocolate chip cookies!!

Someone needs to ==lick out== the bowl. George likes helping Mummy make cookies.

But he likes playing with Peppa more. Baaaa! I want to be a nurse!

I want to be a doctor. But who's gonna be the sick person?

GEORGE!!! Peppa and Suzy love playing doctors and nurses.

So does George. Peppa listens to George's chest.

NoW, George, take a big breath in... then cough.

Mm, I think your heart's a bit loose... ...I'll put a plaster on it.

Baa! Open wide, please. Suzy takes George's temperature.

Oh, dear, you're very, very hot. I think you have to stay in bed for three years.

Daddy Pig has come to find George. Oh, no! What's wrong with George?

Don't worry, Daddy. It's only a game.

George is our patient. Oh, I see. Can the patient have a visitor?

Just for a little while. He might get tired.

Cookies!!! Yes, they're for George. They're his medicine to make him feel better.

Um, excuse me, doctor, Can you help me? I have a sore tummy.

That tickles! I can hear it rumbling. I think you're hungry, Daddy.

Then I think I need lots of cookies to make me better.

And me! And me! And me! Baa
