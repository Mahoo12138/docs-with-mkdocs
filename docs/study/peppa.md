It is raining today. So, Peppa and George cannot play outside. Daddy, it's stopped raining. Can we go out to play? Alright, ==run along you two==. Peppa loves jumping in muddy puddles. I love muddy puddles.

!!! tip "run along you two"
    **run along** —— 1. 走开	2. 延伸，贯穿，Run along 一般是爸爸妈妈给孩子说话的时候用，就是走吧，去吧的意思。Run along you two，你俩去玩吧。再举个例子，Run along now and play for a bit，去吧，去玩会儿吧。

Goodness me. Daddy. Daddy. **Guess what we've been doing.**

    口语表达，意为“天哪！”，**goodness**，used to express any strong emotion, especially surprise:
    

    - (My) goodness! how many more times do I have to tell you !
    - Goodness gracious (me), what a terrible thought !

    **have been doing** 是现在完成进行时：表示一直在做，表示动作从过去某一时间开始，一直持续到现在，也可也表示某种经历。在这里表示 peppa 和 geroge 刚才一直在玩。

### 不仅仅是英语

+ 当佩奇妈妈看到佩奇在泥水坑里蹦迪时，并没有因为太脏而阻拦她，或者是埋怨责骂她，而是告诉她要玩就要把靴子穿上，而告诉我们的是，在教育孩子的时候，不应太过强势，应该以商量的口吻与孩子交谈，如果是埋怨或者责骂，孩子肯定会根植于心灵，毕竟父母是孩子的最好的老师，在没有自己的思想时，啥都会跟着学。
+ 当佩奇和弟弟弄得一身脏的走进屋的时候，爸爸明显一眼就能看出来这俩经历了什么，但爸爸并没有马上生气和责骂或置之不理，而是温和地回答佩奇的问题，并且说要在妈妈看到之前洗干净，充分给予孩子尊重让孩子学会处理问题。
